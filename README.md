These are my dotfiles.

This creates a symlink between the dotfile zshrc and the normal home directory one.
`ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc`

The same for ideavim:
`ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.ideavimrc ~/.ideavimrc`

for the `v` command check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxGIG_lcA&list=LL&index=4)
